# Revival - Sloopy

## Brief
Sloopy is a revival of Oswald Cooper’s ubiquitous Cooper Black. Looking at more recent revivals, I wanted to make sure there was a clear distinction from Cooper Black and this interpretation. Revivals that were too similar fell into a sort of “uncanny valley” in my mind. This revival seeks to not simply translate the original into digital, but instead update aspects of the design into some- thing new and more appropriate for a digital typeface. More specifically, Sloopy was given a higher x-height, and the looser stroke treatment was straightened out. Sloopy was also designed with added contrast as well as adding the balls and “tucks” seen in lowercase glyphs such as the “y” or “f.”

Sloopy is intended for display usage. The initial brief that inspired the design was print car advertisements of the 1970’s and 80’s. These ads often had some clever or just nonsensical saying, which felt appropriate for a slightly goofy typeface. Basically, I wanted to make an ad for the AMC Pacer. Let’s hope the doors don’t fall off.

Initial ideation for how to approach the revival. As mentioned, I felt it was important to create something that was distinctly different from the original Cooper. Of these ideas, condensing, adding contrast, and raising the x-height felt both attainable and enough of a departure from the original.

The first task was to focus in on a system for the different elements. The first pass at this was, of course, not incredibly successful. The first proof, above, has inconsistent treatment of weight, serifs, and spacing. While not entirely resolved, by the third class (lower of the above proofs) these elements became more regular. Serifs became softer and larger, while also flattenining at the top as seen in the "H." Looking at the right side, the weight and overall color became much more regular. Lastly, the descender height was reduced significantly to better fit the character of the typeface.
